The nozzle at the think\u00a5[box\u00a5] is .4mm absolute minimum size of fine objects is 1.2mm. A better size for thin walls and supports is 1.6mm. 1.5mm or 1.7 mm are not good. 2.0mm or 2.4mm are even better. Keep overhanging parts extending out less than 45 degrees. This allows layers to overlap a bit and slowly extend out wider. 45 degrees is the max otherwise the printer tries to print in mid air and all the filament falls to the ground. Objects must be fully connected and \"manifold\" or \"watertight\" You can't have pieces floating in the air or close but not touching. Don't have small voids. Make the pieces solid and uniform. You can have a hollow vase or container but all its parts and walls should be connected and solid.

These concepts still hold true for more organic creative work but may not be as necessary. Example of model showing Mechanical 3D Print Guidelines Gussets or supporting pieces like wings give more structure to elements.|# 3D Printing This tutorial will Prerequisites \u00b6 To complete this tutorial you should be familiar with Instructions \u00b6 The first step Futher Reading \u00b6 External Links \u00b6 Uniform Walls help with deformation and warping. Fillets or rounded interior corners add strength and help with warping. Ribs also shown, connect vertical pieces to other vertical pieces or walls. Chamfers or angled interior corners add strength and help with warping like fillets do. Rounded Corners put less stress on the corners and are smoother to print. 3D Printing Terms \u00b6 These are some common words and terminology used in 3D Printing Vertex - the base unit of a polygon model. It is a point in space defined by an x, y and z coordinate. Can be moved around and \"welded\" to other vertexes or connected to another vertex with an edge. Edge - the line connecting two vertexes in a polygon model. Edges make closed shaped that are called faces Face - the enclosed shape made by connected vertexes and edges. Can be a triangle, a quad (four-sides) or an N-Gon Triangle - simplest planar shape. STLs are made of triangle but triangles should be avoided if possible when modeling since they cannot be subdivided easily and do not make smooth forms. Quad - A four sided polygon. This is generally the best shape to make your model from. N-Gon - A polygon with (n) sides. These should be avoided. With T-Splines you may have some n-gons but it is best to make them into quads if you can. Mesh - The structure of a 3D model. It is made of of points (vertexes), edges and polygon faces. Bounding Box - the smallest box that your model can fit in. IT is a rectangular prism defined by a height, width and length. Raft - bottom support for a 3D print to help it adhere to the print bed when the print starts and to keep the print from falling over when the print gets taller. Infill - Support material in the middle of a 3D print. Can be made of different patterns and is usually not solid. Sometimes described in percentage terms, less infill will make a faster print and use less material while a higher percentage infill will take longer to print and use more material. Support Material - extra printed material used to support parts of the print that overhang more than 45 degrees in the horizontal direction. Sometime a model can be orientated on the printer at a different angle to avoid support material. Can be removed but often messes up the surface where it attached to the print. Parametric - A 3D model driven by defined dimensions and parameters Solid - A 3D model that is not a plane or open shape. It is a full solid object. Polygon - A 3 or more sided shape. The surfaces of 3D models are made of polygons STL (STereoLithography) - the most common file format used for 3D printing. It is made of a fine triangle mesh. This file format works for 3D printing but is not good for modeling. Always save the original model file so you can make changes. It is possible to edit an STL file but it is much easier to edit the original 3D model. Print in Place (PIP) - Method of printing moving parts such as hinges and joints in a 3D print in one operation. This produces forms that would not be possible with traditional manufacturing techniques. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) - Most common method of affordable 3D printing. This method uses a thermoplastic filament, or wire, on a spool that is fed through a nozzle. Heat melts the thermoplastic and new layers are fused to previous layers in order to make the print. 3D Printing Links runx \u00b6 https://hackaday.com/2018/01/14/aluminum-no-match-for-3d-printed-press-brake-dies/ https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/how-design-snap-fit-joints-3d-printing https://3dprint.com/169757/103dp-nintendo-switch/ Understanding & Designing for FDM Tolerances | All3DP Pro https://m.all3dp.com/2/engineering-tolerance-definition-drawing/ Researchers 3D-printed a cell-sized tugboat https://www.engadget.com/researchers-3-dprinted-a-microscopic-boat-to-see-how-bacteria-swim-105633277.html Are 3D printed watermarks a \u201cgrave and growing\u201d threat to people\u2019s privacy? - 3D Printing Industry https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/are-3d-printed-watermarks-a-grave-and-growing-threat-to-peoples-privacy-176309/ Printed Sewing Machine Parts Extend Singer\u2019s Range | Hackaday https://hackaday.com/2021/12/03/print-sewing-machine-parts-extend-singers-range/ I developed a design method to print trim parts larger than the build volume https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/s2aj5r/i_developed_a_design_method_to_print_trim_parts/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share","title":"3D Printing"},{"location":"3D%20Printing/#3d-printing","text":"3D Printing is an additive processes of Fabrication .","title":"3D Printing"},{"location":"3D%20Printing/#types-of-3d-printers","text":"","title":"Types of 3D Printers"},{"location":"3D%20Printing/#fdm-printers","text":"","title":"FDM Printers"},{"location":"3D%20Printing/#resin-printers","text":"","title":"Resin Printers"},{"location":"3D%20Printing/#dual-print-head-printers","text":"","title":"Dual Print Head Printers"},{"location":"3D%20Printing/#laser-sintering-printers","text":"","title":"Laser Sintering Printers"},{"location":"3D%20Printing/#general-3d-print-rules-for-ffd-printing-without-dissolvable-supports","text":"Keep thin and small parts multiples of the nozzle size.

for Artists \u00b6 Requirements of a Contract \u00b6 Consideration something of value must be offered by both parties otherwise it is a gift Mutual Assent must agree on terms and the meanings of words Offer and Acceptance must be clearly stated and communicated, we want to do this Legal Purpose can\u2019t make a contract to rob a bank Capable Parties usually can\u2019t make contracts with minors, bankrupts, prisoners, or adults without all mental faculties Elements of a Contract \u00b6 Introduction States general facts, has a lot of \u201cWHEREAS\u2026\u201d clauses and paragraphs. Will likely change Your Name to \u201cArtist\u201d and Main Street Gallery to \u201cVenue\u201d or Super Awesome Production Studios to \u201cClient\u201d Purpose of the Agreement Why is this contract being agreed to? Are you having a show? Releasing copyright? Commissioning a work of art? Is the show in Nevada or Ohio? Responsibilities of both Parties What is each party obligated to do? When? What conditions change those obligations? Representations and Warranties Artist usually represent that a work is theirs and original One might represent that the work is of sound construction, no wet paint dripping on the floor Boilerplate Clauses Important to read and understand, cover many common elements of contracts and agreements Signature Block You have to clearly sign and agree to the contract by signing somewhere Attachments Often there are additional documents to reference in the contract and they are referred to as attachments or exhibits, and are included at the end. Miscilanious Provisions \u00b6 Payment Terms Timeline Revision or Design Schedule Termination Clauses Budget Progress Report Schedule Installation Terms Approval and Acceptance \u2013 so important to spell out Taxes Duration of the agreement \u2013 is it forever? Insurance Ownership rights \u2013 Copyright Reproduction Rights Artist rights \u2013 VARA Death or Incapacity Independent Contractor? Amendments to contract? How? Payment Terms \u00b6 Do you get paid on signing the contract? When do you get paid? How much? Are there approvals necessary to get paid? Who approves the work? How? Verbal? Written? When? What if there is a disagreement? Who controls the budget? Are you reimbursed for expenditures or receive a lump payment? What happens in termination? Timeline \u00b6 Outline when everything will happen. How long after a painting sells until you get paid? How long does a work sit in gallery until you can have it back? What happens if timelines slip? Consider writing timelines \u201c3 weeks after completion of \u2026\u201d rather than using hard dates. When does the contract begin and end? How? Revision or Design Schedule \u00b6 Related to the timeline. Must be clearly spelled out. How are designs approved? How many revisions? At what cost? Who decides? What happens when no one agrees? Termination \u00b6 Client for cause Artist for cause Death or incapacity Force Majeure What happens to payment terms? What about disputes? Term or Duration \u00b6 When does the contract start? When does it end? Some provisions may last longer than the agreement such as licenses, be sure to explicitly state duration of terms. In perpetuity can be helpful for licenses. Ownership Rights \u00b6 Reproduction rights Who owns the copyright? Who can make images of the work? Do the rights expire? Are they exclusive? Is there a limit on types of media? T-shirts? Coffee cups? Ownership \u00b6 You may not own the physical work but you may still own the copyright Maintenance agreement for commissioned pieces If you do not write any of the words of a contract it is likely not written in your best interest. Contract Changes \u00b6 Remember Mutual Assent? Both parties have to agree. So if you do not agree, change the agreement until you can agree. This is a negotiation process. In some situations you will have little power to negotiate in others you will have much more. Remember to not only look for things to \u201cremove\u201d from a contract, look for missing things as well that you need to add. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask. Do you really want to work with someone who is mad at you for asking about a contract? They may not agree to the proposed changes but you should always ask. Examples of Additions and Clarifications \u00b6 Where is the electricity? How many amps? Whose power cords? How many volunteers? Art handlers? Who pays for shipping? In a bag or a crate? Insured? Is the gallery open daily? Or only once a month? Is the exhibition only of your work or a group show? How many works in the show? Who hangs the work? Who buys plane tickets? Do you get reimbursed later or get a ticket sent to you? Will equipment be rented? Who pays? How many days? What about insurance? Liability? Can they take photos of your work and sell them? How long can you use my images / video for publicity and paid advertising? Boilerplate Provisions \u00b6 Can seem like a lot but matter when needed. Make sure to read and understand all of them. Boilerplate Clauses \u00b6 Warranties \u00b6 Promises or assurances made by either party. Especially important in commission work. You will warrantee that the painting or ceramic piece won\u2019t fall apart. Notice \u00b6 How will the parties contact each other? Registered mail? Email? What address? This is important for payment, termination and force majeure. Relationships \u00b6 Not the romantic kind. Usually prevents parties from claiming a business relationship. Allows for contract work and avoiding workers compensation and payroll taxes. Indemnification \u00b6 A \u201dhold harmless\u201d provision. It is a transfer of risk. It shifts potential costs from one party to another. Can be one way or two way. Always try to get a mutual indemnification. Protects the party from losses from third party claims. Copyright is a good example. You will also likely \u201cwarranty\u201d that you own the copyright of your work but an indemnification clause add additional protection. Choice of law \u00b6 What law will you use? Generally you will be in the same State but with out of State agreements this can begin to matter. Jurisdiction \u00b6 Similar to above but decides where any lawsuits or other court actions must be filed. If you have to file in California, it may cause additional expenses. Force Majeure \u00b6 Floods, terrorism, tornadoes, hurricanes, sink holes, Covid-19 \u2013 what happens with these events \u2013 unlikely but should be in there. If it is a specific list of situation it may offer less protection then more broad and vague terms. Assignment \u00b6 Allows or does not allow the parties to transfer rights in the contract to other people. Common in artist contracts, if you contract Anish Kapoor to decorate your living room, you don\u2019t want Anish to \u201cassign\u201d that right to someone off the street. Attachments \u00b6 Very common in artist contracts. Sometimes called \u201cexhibits\u201d but are just documents that are attached to the contract and become part of the agreement. Often referred to in the text of the contract. Integration \u00b6 States that the contract represents the total or the final agreement of the parties. If you have an email that says you get paid 1,000,000 but the contract says 100, guess what you are getting paid? (Note: there are special laws that govern written correspondence leading up to a contract. Ask a lawyer.) Headings \u00b6 States that headings in the document have no meaning Severability \u00b6 Allows the contract to stand and be enforced if one part is invalid. You contract with a gallery and it says artist responsible for robbing a bank. The rest of the contract is still valid, including you getting paid, even if the invalid bank clause is taken out, if you have a severability clause. This is in the current news with the potential invalidation of the Affordable Care Act by the Supreme Court. Do I need a lawyer? \u00b6 Yes, you do. It may not be necessary as you sign some basic agreements in the beginning of your career but there is a threshold where it is a good idea to hire an attorney. Is your threshold $100? $1,000? $10,000? $100,000? In your career you will handle many similar contracts. After you use an attorney on a certain type, you are likely able to handle that type of contract on your own in the future. It is a good idea to hire an attorney again if you need a new type of contract or if the stakes significantly increase. Remember, there are free resources available.","title":"Contracts for Artists"},{"location":"Contracts%20for%20Artists/#contracts-for-artists","text":"","title":"Contracts for Artists"},{"location":"Contracts%20for%20Artists/#requirements-of-a-contract","text":"Consideration something of value must be offered by both parties otherwise it is a gift Mutual Assent must agree on terms and the meanings of words Offer and Acceptance must be clearly stated and communicated, we want to do this Legal Purpose can\u2019t make a contract to rob a bank Capable Parties usually can\u2019t make contracts with minors, bankrupts, prisoners, or adults without all mental faculties","title":"Requirements of a Contract"},{"location":"Contracts%20for%20Artists/#elements-of-a-contract","text":"Introduction States general facts, has a lot of \u201cWHEREAS\u2026\u201d clauses and paragraphs.

Put large piece of smooth cardboard underneath paper and have it stick out to the left at least 2\u201d Lay T-shirt down flat and smooth facing up Find center of T-Shirt with Ruler a. Measure at the shoulders b. Measure at the chest or bottom of armhole c. Measure at the bottom hem d. Do not measure at the neck since it might not be in the center e. Put pins in the shirt vertically at each center point The shirt is likely a rectangle, any distortion is likely from wearing it Move shirt to clean edge Pins should be directly on top of clean edge (don\u2019t fold the T-shirt) a. Front and back of shirt should be evenly on top of each other b. Check that the seams are on top of each other c. Make sure the shirt is flat With a pencil, draw the bottom and side of the shirt on the paper. Stop at the bottom of the armhole Draw vertical lines at the tip of armhole, bottom of arm hole and outside points of sleeve Pin armhole bottom Poke every \u00bd\u201d through center seam Pin through front neckline, through the rib seam At the back neck, start at the vertical line, pine through the center of the back-neck tape Remove pins Lightly sketch and connect dots with a pencil Use triangle or t square to draw 90 angles from the center at the front and back neck curves Check if there is a drop or rise on the lower hem \u2013 hem usually comes up for a fitted T Lower lines should start at 90 Straighten the shoulder seam with a ruler Top of armhole seam is 90 degrees with top of shoulder Use a French curve to smooth out arm hole seam Side seam is either straight down or curved in from armhole Use French Curve to draw front and back necklines Necklines must meet center at 90 degrees for 1/8\u201d As little of neckline as possible should be flat but must meet at shoulder Use clear plastic ruler and measure the length of the top and bottom necks. Start at 1\u201d on the ruler and hold the ruler vertically Write down the measurements on the inside of the pattern pieces Use the ruler to measure the length if the arm hole Write down the measurement on the inside of the pattern Mark the center of the armhole Double check by measuring from both sides of the armhole Cut out back neck void Label the pattern pieces in pen on the front of the pattern center line down to the right on the grainline Label the back void piece ( Do not lose this piece ) T-Shirt Sleeve Pattern Drafting \u00b6 1. Draw a 90 degrees L that is about 10\u201d x 10\u201d 2. Put shirt upside down with top fold of sleeve on line. The top of the arm hole should be in the corner 3. Pin through arm hole seam every \u00bd\u201d 4. Measure sleeve cap armhole seam with flexible ruler. It should be the same as the torso pattern 5. Halfway up put a notch on armhole seam 6. Straighten lower sleeve with ruler 7. Does not have to be 90 degrees under the arm 8. Draw grainline perpendicular to the top 9. Cut out the sleeve 10. Measure the height of the rib collar 11. Draw square rectangle double the length of front neck and void piece square off the ends \u2013 should be 15-20% smaller than the neck Drafting Full Pattern Pieces \u00b6 1. Get new piece of Paper 2. Lay torso piece on paper and trace around 3. Flip over the center to mirror and trace full pattern 4. Tur up lines and transfer armhole notches 5. Center line becomes the grainline 6. Add seam allowances with your clear ruler a. \u00bd\u201d seam allowance is safe, add 5/8\u201d if you want more option to change fit b. \u00bc\u201d seam allowance on neckline c. Add \u215e\u201d to \u00be\u201d at bottom for hem 7. Use back void piece to draw back pattern 8. Draw sleeve pattern, repeating the steps above Pants Pattern \u00b6 Front Leg Piece \u00b6 1. Lay down with front piece flat on top 2. Poke pin waist band of pants 3. Poke pins along outside seam 4. Remove pants 5. Pencil in lines lightly with pencil 6. Average middle of pants draw a vertical grain line 7. Get Hip curve 8. Draw top of hip 9. Use long ruler to straighten out the outside led 10. Crotches start straight at the top and then make a J 11. For inseam, don\u2019t push out too far 12. Measure inseam, out seam, waist and write measurements on the inside of the pattern 13. True the pocket void 14. Side seam is 90 degrees at pocket 15. Slash pockets straight line 16. Label down and to the right Back Pants Piece \u00b6 1. Lay pants face down 2. Smooth out \u2013 stretch and smooth the crotch to lay flat \u2013 working on the side that has the fly may help to make pants lay flat 3. Poke pin the waist band 4. If pants have a back yoke, skip it since it needs to be isolated on its own 5. Poke pin the crotch J 6. Remove pants and trace pin lines 7. Rear crotch J can be an s curve 8. Measure inseam, out seam and waist 9. Adjust inseam and out seam to match front 10. Keep J and waist proportions and placements 11. Need to add yoke height if it is there 12. Mark dart locations if present a. Pin the dartline marking the beginning and the end of the dart b. Measure the width of the dart c. Add the width of the dart to each side of the pattern piece when truing the pattern d. Taper the dart width into the side of the pattern about double the length of the dart 13.

Material is poured into the mold and then removed after it solidifies. Types of Molds \u00b6 One piece mold Two part mold Multi part mold Mother mold Molds can either be designed to be reusable or just for a single use. All molds have a finite lifespan but with care can be made to make numerous castings. One Part Mold \u00b6 A one part mold is the simplest type of mold. It can be easily made with some wet mud and your hand. Simply press your hand into the wet mud and remove it. You can then pour [[plaster]] or other material into the negative space left by your hand and let it set. This would give you a copy of the positive form of one side of your hand. One part molds are often used in the making of plaques, signs and other flat planer and decorative objects. The downside of one part mold is that the back side of the casting will be dictated by how the material settles into the mold rather than buy a defined shape as in a two-part mold. Two Part Mold \u00b6 A two-part mold is made of two sides that join together in a specific way. Keys or other shapes that fit together help align the pieces of the mold. Often a material is used as a gasket in between the two halves of the mold to keep the mold from leaking. Straps or rubber bands can also be used to hold the two sides tightly together. And opening in the mold allows for the casting material to be poured in. Then the two halves are separated and the casting is removed. Usually there is a thin or a flange of the casting material that follows the shape of the joining seam of the mold. This material needs to be removed from the casting in a process called [[chasing]]. Multi Part Mold \u00b6 Multi-part molds have more than two pieces. These molds are used for casting complex shapes that may have undercuts and other details that cannot be accommodated with a single part mold or a two-part mold. A special type of multi-part mold is a mother mold. This is a mold that has a soft inner structure that is supported by a rigid outer structure called a mother mold. Mold Design Considerations \u00b6 Mold making is a technical process that can be improved by considering the materials and intent of the final casting. A single use mold is much different than a mold designed to make hundreds of castings. Undercuts \u00b6 When making any mold, it is important to pay attention to undercuts. Undercuts are part of that cannot pull out cleanly without breaking the mold. For complex shapes more than two piece molds maybe necessary. Another way to contend with undercuts is to use a flexible mold material for the mold that can bend around the final cast pieces. Single use molds can also be used and broken away from the final casting as is often done in metal casting. Complex shapes can also be broken up into smaller shapes that do not have undercuts and then joined together after all the cast pieces are made. Mold Keys \u00b6 Keys can help align and register the different pieces of multi-part molds. This is very important, so the final shape of the casting is accurate. Mold keys have many different designs, but should be made to simply snap together and align the shape and be easily decipherable by the mold maker and caster.

Hybrid? \u00b6 A hybrid approch to public and private information would make just about everything on the wiki publicly accessible but some links may go to private school resources. This isn't much different that what would happen with the public model. A true hybrid approach would have an authentication system so some information was only viewable to certain users. This will add uneeded friction and complexity Single Editor or multiple \u00b6 Single Editor \u00b6 If only a single editor has control then it is more of a public digital garden. Changes could be suggested by users or students but would be committed by a single author. This is likely the best way to start the wiki, although it is not really a wiki unless there are multiple contributors. Multiple Editors \u00b6 If there are multiple editors there likely needs to be an approval process of edits, although this could be combersome. Ideally if the wiki grows to have enough valuable resources then the more people that contribute the better. This is a long term goal of the project. There could be a handful of approved editors that are able to make changes. Ifthere are mulitple editors, it limits the backend software to those that can verify credentials and have user accounts. Future Proofing and Avoiding Sofware Lock-In \u00b6 Flat Files vs Database \u00b6 So far everything in this project is written in simple markdown files. These are realatively human deciferable text files that can easily be converted into static HTML documents and viewed on the web. The benefit of using multiple markdown files is that computers should be able to read them forever and it is possible to switch to other platforms. The downside of using markdown is it is not WYSIWYG so if there are multiple editors then the editors must learn markdown. MediaWiki and Wiki.js solve this problem by having visual editors for users that do not know markdown. Both of these use a database to keep track of the content and the media. That is not a problem but it does add complexity to the project and requires a server to host the files. Docuwiki is an option that uses flat files but it also requries a hosting server because it is put together with PHP. Choosing a Platform \u00b6 The main choice is between a Static Site Generator like Jekyll or Hugo and an actual wiki software . The platform should be easy to edit on mobile and desktop. It should be designed mobile first and accessible. Needs to be able to support lots of embeded images, videos and sounds. Needs wikilinks and backlinks. Needs to be easily skinnable and customizalbe. It must use open formats for all data storage so mirgration to different hosting and or platforms in the future is possible.

Is important to know how to use a camera to create high resolution while exposed images of your artwork. 3 Main Camera Settings \u00b6 There are three main camera settings that photographers need to understand to be able to control a camera and take the photographs they want. Photographers need to know how to control shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Shutter speed is how long the camera lets light in. The longer the camera stays open, the more light will come in and affect the exposure. A fast shutter speed will also freeze motion, while a slow shutter speed will allow for motion blur and trailing artifacts of objects in motion. Aperture is the hole in the camera that lets light in. This can be large or small. The larger the hole is the more light is let in and makes a shallower depth of field, or area in focus. ISO refers to the sensitivity of the digital sensor in the camera. A higher ISO means the sensor will react to lower levels of light. If the ISO is too high, then digital noise can be created. With these three settings, you can understand how to use most still cameras. Each camera manufacturer will have these settings and slightly different places, but the basic principles are the same.

A simple budget written out on a piece of paper is better than nothing and is often the way to start rough project planning. Spreadsheet software such as Excel , [[Google Sheets]], or [[Open Office]] allow even more control for artists to creat budgets and work on different contingencies and plans. As your creative career progreses it is even more important to learn [[how to create an artist budget]]. Contracts \u00b6 Contracts are essential to not being taken advantage of in buisness transactions. Contracts don't guarantee that you won't be taken advantage of but good contracts written with both parties interests faciliate smooth transactions and provide a way to handle disputes. Never enter into a monatary agreement without a signed contract. Many artists make a mistake and work on good faith conversations, but this is a risky way to run a buisness. Ask for advice along the way to learn more about Contracts for Artists . Portfolio \u00b6 Your portfolio is how people will discover your work and how you will get more opportunities. Of couse some people will see your work in person or in a virtual digital world but most will not. It is important to maintain an up to date portfolio of your work. You will likely have different portfolios for different types of work and opportunities. Learn more about [[How to Make an Artist Portfolio]]. Resume / CV \u00b6 Most artist opportunities will require a resume or CV. Even when not applying for a commission or opportunity it is a good idea to have your resume published on your website so people can get an overview of your career and experience.

Often in the excitement of learning a process, making a creative breakthrough, or especially when tired after long hours in the studio, one may be tempted to relax or skip safe working habits. The best way to resist this urge is to make safety an integral part of your work habits and studio practice. Maintain an awareness of your surroundings. Avoid working alone and when tired. General Safety \u00b6 Protect your senses and body, the senses and bodies of others, as well as the environment. The equipment used for protection is generally reffered to as [[Personal Protective Equipment]] shortened as [[Personal Protective Equipment|PPE]]. A well maintained shop or studio will post the required PPE required to enter the space if it is a hazardous environment. Eye Protection \u00b6 Always wear eye protection when working with machines, dangerous tools, hazardous chemicals, or any process that has a chance of directing harmful material towards your face. It is important to where I protection when you are around others who are using machinery or tools as well. Often people will remember to wear eye protection when they are operating a machine but not when they are in close proximity of others engaged in potentially hazardous activities. All eye protection is not the same. Make sure the particular eye protection you are using is appropriate for the hazards presented to you. Eye protection for hazardous chemicals is different than that for high speed projectiles. In some environments you may need more than one type of eye protection. Hearing Protection \u00b6 It is extremely important to protect your ears from loud noises. High decibel noises can cause permanent damage to your ears after even brief exposure. It is often overlooked that lower decibel noises over long periods of time can cause the same damage to your hearing. It is important to protect your ears from both brief high decibel noises and from longer exposure to low decibel sounds. The decibel scale is logarithmic and therefore for each decibel increase in volume It is double the previous amount. So you might think that going from 12 to 20 decibels is only a few more but really it is doubling multiple times. Respiratory Protection \u00b6 Fumes and particulate matter that you breathe will damage your lungs and should be avoided. The best way to protect your lungs is to work with good ventilation and avoid being in an environment with particulate matter or fumes. When that is not possible then a proper respirator for the specific environmental hazards present should be worn. It is important to read [[Material Saftey Data Sheets]] for all of the materials you are using so you can select the proper respirator. Protective Clothing \u00b6 When working with machines or powered tools loose or ill fitting clothing is very dangerous since it can accidentially be caught in the machine and pull you toward a hazard. The same is true for longer hair or body accessories such as watches, rings, bracelets, lanyards, necklaces and scarfs. Gloves are less obvious example of a clothing hazard. Gloves are a great way to protect your hands from some hazards but gloves should NEVER be worn with rotating machinery or machinery with exposed moving parts because the glove can be caught and pull your hand toward the hazard. Avoid the common mistake of wearing gloves with a sander. It is very dangerous to wear gloves with moving machinery. When working with shop or studio equipment use common sense and wear clothing that will protect your skin from sharp surfaces, flying debris, dust, dirt, chemicals or other hazards present in the environment. The protective clothing required for different environmental and equipment hazards varries. Before begining to work double check user manuals and safety procedures.","title":"Safety"},{"location":"Safety/#safety","text":"In order to protect oneself and to have a long and successful career, artists and makers need to learn about and follow best safety practices.

Generally, the pieces are cut in specific shapes that after so together will create a three-dimensional form. Often these forms are to fit around the shape of the human body or a piece of architecture. Hand Sewing vs Machine Sewing \u00b6 Hand sewing can be done anywhere and doesn't need electricity. Early sewing machines also did not need electricity but instead used the caloric burn of the operator through a foot pedal to move the needle and make stitches. The stitches made by hand are different than those made by a lock stitch machine. A machine stitch will generally be more consistent, faster, and stronger than a hand stitch. Whenever possible a machine should be used to see materials together so time is not wasted with less effective hand stitching. Just about every kind of stitch can be made by various sewing machines. A notable exception is a decorative hand stitched buttonhole. Types of Hand Stitches \u00b6 Blind stitch Blanket stitch Whip stich Buttonhole stich Backstich Types of Machines \u00b6 Lock Stich Overlook Stitch Domestic vs Industrial Machines \u00b6 Domestic or consumer sewing machines are cheap and versatile. Most can to a multitude o stitch types but because they are not single purpose built they tend to do each task worse than a dedicated machine. For example, on multi-purpose domestic machine may have an edge stitch function to try to capture fraying fabric edges, but it would be no match for even a domestic serger. All domestics sewing machines can sew in a straight line, but they will be limited in the thickness of fabric that they can sew through, and the number of layers of even thin fabric that they can sew through as well as how thicker thread can't be used. Generally, if one is careful, they can work around these issues. But eventually the strength and specific built purpose of industrial machines is essential to make sewn objects. Different Machine Sewn Seams \u00b6 Straight \u00b6 A straight seam is made by placing the 'right' sides of the fabric together lining up the edges. Then the fabric is fed through the sewing machine under the presser foot with the desired seam allowance, which is how much space is left between the stitching and the cut edge. True Flat Felled \u00b6 A true flat-filled seem has interlocking edges of fabric and two sets of stitching going through four layers of the fabric. This is done with specialty equipment and machines that feed the fabric into the presser foot and make the fold. With a bit of practice and some ingenuity, this can also be made on a straight stitch machine or a domestic home sewing machine. It is not as fast but it is just as strong. Flat-filled seams are often used on the inside inseam of pants so they do not split since they go through four layers of fabric. Faux Flat Felled \u00b6 A Faux Flat Felled seam is made starting with the wrong sides of the fabric together lining up the edges. Then press the seam to one side. Trim the lower seam allowance in half. Fold the top seam allowance around the bottom seam allowance enclosing it. Use an iron to press the seam allowance flat and around the bottom allowance. Make sure the width is even. Stitch a second set of stitches along this folded edge. This seam is not as strong as a true flat-felled seam that goes through four layers of fabric twice. French Seam \u00b6 A french seam is made by placing the wrong sides of the fabric together lining up the edges. Busted Seam \u00b6 This seam is often seen on the outside of jeans. Sometimes it uses the selvage edge of the fabric. The selvage edge of the fabric is the factory edge that does not unravel. Other times it uses surged edges of fabric. It is a basic straight seam that then is pressed flat and open, or \"busted\" open.

You need to use a larger needle. We have larger needles and the cabinet. A size 16 or 18 will work. You also need to adjust the bobbin case tension. When adjusting the bobbin case tension the little turn of the screw goes a long way. Maybe eighth to a quarter turn.

All domestics sewing machines can sew in a straight line, but they will be limited in the thickness of fabric that they can sew through, and the number of layers of even thin fabric that they can sew through as well as how thicker thread can't be used. Generally, if one is careful, they can work around these issues.

Pencils and paper are relatively cheap and with practice it only takes a few minutes to sketch out an idea in order to begin to evaluate it. Once you sketch out multiple ideas, then you can compare and edit them through a constant process of improvement. Detailed sketches can explore different parts of an idea or concept before making three dimensional mockups either in a computer or with analog means such as Paper Mach\u00e9 or cardboard. Ideation Sketching \u00b6 Idea Generation vs Idea Iteration \u00b6 Introduction to Technical Sketching \u00b6 We need to be able to communicate our complex ideas of three-dimensional forms in a simple visual way. I can go sketching achieve this. There are two types of technical sketching two-dimensional sketching and three-dimensional sketching. 3D sketching really helps one visualize how a part or a design will exist in the physical world. 2D sketching can show how a part would be manufactured in gift precise details such as dimensions and other information. Why do we use sketches? Sketches are a very efficient way to communicate. We have all heard the cliche that a picture is worth a thousand words This is even more so in technical sketching. Take for instance a 4 inch cube that is easy enough to describe with words. Now we need to edit this cube and we could still describe it with words with a corner cut out. What if we chamfer all the edges still not so bad now let's add some holes and a convex shape to this. What if we also have some rounded forms on the edge. Now this starts to become more complex and the sketches are more efficient than using words and more precise and repeatable Everything that we do with the computer today can be done with a couple triangles a t-square and a compass and protractor. Although you do not need become an expert in hand drafting to be successful in 3D design you do need to know the concepts of sketching two-dimensional and three-dimensional designs We can clean up our hand drawn designs and sketches in a computer for very precise modeling. Just because the computer can do things doesn't mean that you don't need to understand the concepts and skills of technical sketching. We will use our hands to quickly draw all the conceptual elements of a technical sketch and then we will put this information into a computer to model our designs and then output precise computer generated technical sketches as needed There are a few different types of three-dimensional technical sketches we have isometric sketches oblique sketches and perspective sketches. For the most part we will be using isometric sketches sometimes we will have prospective sketches to make a conceptual visualization but they are less useful for actual technical sketching. Two dimensional sketching we will use multi-view sketches that show the top side and front of an object. These will be lined up in playing with each other so that we can see how the different size relate to each other along with hidden elements shown by dotted lines.

A wood screw acts as a clamp and pulls the top piece of wood toward the bottom piece. The threads of a wood screw are spaced apart to reduce the chance of tearing out material. A wood screw should spin freely in the top piece to allow for maximum clamping force. Wood screws are strong but are brittle and should be avoided where movement of the pieces is expected. Drywall Screws \u00b6 Drywall screws should be used to attach drywall or gypsum board to building framing. Drywall Screws are very hard and brittle and therefore should not be used for wood assembly. Drywall screws are ubiquitous and are seemingly laying around everywhere. yYou will see many makers, professional and amateur, use drywall screws to assemble wood.

Now sculpture has expanded to encompass all forms of making ranging from previously used stone and clay to electronics, welding, organic foods, fur, glass, performance, video , computers, and Virtual Reality. Other than focusing on 3D dimensional space versus the 2D concerns of drawing, painting, and photography there are no real limits or boundaries for sculpture. This was famously described by Rosalind Krauss in the 1979 October article \"Sculpture in the Expanded Field\". ^[Krauss, Rosalind. \u201cSculpture in the Expanded Field.\u201d October 8 (1979): 31\u201344. https://doi.org/10.2307/778224.] The wide array of materials and processes available to a sculptor is great because it allows any concept and idea to be realized. This wide field of possibilities is also a burden because so many techniques and ways of making must be learned in order to successfully realize different ideas. What is a Sculpture? \u00b6 The form of the question already limits the answer. By asking what a sculpture is. We are already assuming it is the discreet object. Is that always the case? \"What is the practice of sculpture?\" may be a better question. Or at least asking what is the purpose of the action? Does the action result in a physical change in the universe? Does it affect people who would see or feel or touch or smell or taste the results of a proposed action? What if the action never happens and it is just a concept? Types of Sculpture \u00b6 There are many types of sculpture but the unifying attribute of all of them as that they exist in 3D space. Even 100% conceptual sculptures exist in the 3D space occupying the synapses of the brain. Low Relief Sculpture vs Freestanding Sculpture \u00b6 Low Relief Sculpture resembles two dimensional art more than three dimensional free standing sculpture. Low Relief Sculpture extends out from a flat or planer surface. Parts of it can be fully 3D but will resemble \"peninsulas of sculpture\" that protrude out from a plane. The plane can be flat, geometric, round, organic or undulating but will defer be planar in nature and have a \"back\". Installation \u00b6 Sculptural [[art installation|art installations]] can be site-specific or non site-specific. Interactive Sculpture \u00b6 Some sculptures or art installations become more alive or complete once an audience engages withe the art. This audience interaction can be as simple as being in the same spaces, the artwork can be as complex as a computer vision driven people tracking device using Physical Computing . Representational Sculpture \u00b6 For much of history most scultpture was representational, meaning that it attempted to visually depiect physical forms visible in the world. Non-Representational Sculpture \u00b6 Site Specific Sculpture \u00b6 Site Specific artwork and sculpture is made for a specific location or locations. It meaning, intent and reception will change if displayed in another location or context. Some site specific sculpture that relies on the architecture of a particular place for physical support may not even be able to be displayed anywhere else without heavy modifications. Earthworks \u00b6 Earthworks are a special type of site specific sculpture that use the landscape as site. Earthworks are usually large in scale and alter the surrounding area and earth into the form of the sculpture. The sculpture and the site become one. Public Art \u00b6 Public art is generally made on a commission basis. Artists or artworks are selected by public agencies through an open competitive process. Public art is made of durable materials designed to last a long time exposed to environmental elements. Kinetic Sculpture \u00b6 [[Kinetic Sculpture]] is not static but moves in space. The source of the movement could be a motor, or a natural cause such as flowing water, or the wind. How to make a Sculpture? \u00b6 What is your idea? What do you want to communicate? Are you making a unique object or a series. Setting up an Artist Studio will give you a place to make sculpture. Generally it is a good idea to start with sketching out different ideas and variations of those ideas. Sculpture Processes and Methods \u00b6 mold making welding brazing sewing felting casting Paper Mach\u00e9 concrete metal structures clay modeling electronics plastic forming painting powder coating Patinas Hole Punching Rope Lashing Woodworking Soldering Tapping and Dieing Riveting Crochet Armatures Skinning Ways of Making Objects \u00b6 There are only five main ways to make any physical object. The ways of making any three-dimensional object are [[additive]], Subtractive Processes , Fabrication , [[deformation]] and Casting . These ways of making do not exisit in isolation and often will be combined to make a final sculptural object or installation. Sewing \u00b6 Sewing is a Fabrication process using fabric and thread. The types of fabric and thread vary widely depending on the desired outcome. Sewing relies on assembling flat planar pieces of fabric in ways that make a three-dimensional form. Welding \u00b6 Welding joins different pieces of metal together to make a new piece of metal that is actually a single piece. The metal is melted and fused together usually using a filler rod of metal. Common types of welding can be include oxyacetylene welding, TIG welding, MIG welding, and stick Arc Welding. [[Brazing]] is a sculptural process related to welding since it joins multiple pieces of metal together but instead of melting the joined pieces, brazing merely heats them to a red hot temperature. This expands the grain structure of the metals so there is physical space between the grain structure. A filler metal that melts at a cooler temperature that the metals being joined is used to mechanically attach the metals. The melted joining metal flows into the gaps of the red hot expanded metal pieces. Flux is used to promote the capillary flow of the filler metal into these spaces. After everything cools the pieces are now mechanically joined. Clay Sculpting \u00b6 [[Clay sculpture]] is an [[additive]] and Subtractive Processes , sculpture process. Pieces of clay are joined together or cut away to make the desired form. Clay is malleable and can be easily deformed to achieve a desired shape. Two common types of clay used in sculpture are water based ceramic clay and oil based [[oil clay]].
