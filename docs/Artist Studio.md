# Artist Studio
Artists need a place to make their work. An artist's workspace is called their studio. It is important to have good studio practices,good [[professional practices]], and good [[safety]] practices. 

## Setting up a Studio
An artist may use a studio temporarily or over many years. In its simplest form an artists stuio is a place to make work and to store completed work. A basic studio should have:

- good lighting
- adequate ventilation
- sturdy worksurfaces
- chairs
- storage space
- [[Tools|tools for making]]
- raw materials

Nothing else is needed to get started making in the studio.  As you begin working you will develop custom methods that will require rearraning the layout of your studio. A process may require a single long table or many seperate small tables. Your skills will develop and dictate what equipment is needed in your studio.  A studio is a constant work in progress and is always in flux, following the creativity of the artist.

## Batch process everything 
Make Studio Work Like a One Person Factory. Instead of doing all the steps of a process in order if you need to make 50 of something. And do step one 50 times then step two 50 times then step 3 50 times then step four 50 times. This will be much faster and efficient and will result in higher quality output. Then if you did step one then step two then step three, then step four 50 times in a row.

## Media Compentency vs Literacy
The difference between media competency and media literacy media literacy is just being a consumer of the content media competency is being able to make a podcast or produce something.
