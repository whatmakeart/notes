# Software for Artists
Computers and software greatly expande the creative potential for artists yet sometimes artists are hesitant to embrace digital tools. This is understandable since so much of creation is done with analog tools such as sketching on paper or making cardboard models but once one becomes proficient with digital tools then the use of digital tools comes as natural as reaching for a pencil.
