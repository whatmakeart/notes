This tutorial will show you how to make a copy of a t-shirt pattern from an existing shirt.
## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial you should be familiar with
## Instructions
### T-Shirt Torso Pattern Drafting
1. Lay Paper down long ways with short end parallel to table and long clean end perpendicular to table.
2. Put large piece of smooth cardboard underneath paper and have it stick out to the left at least 2”
3. Lay T-shirt down flat and smooth facing up
4. Find center of T-Shirt with Ruler
	a. Measure at the shoulders
	b. Measure at the chest or bottom of armhole
	c. Measure at the bottom hem
	d. Do not measure at the neck since it might not be in the center
	e. Put pins in the shirt vertically at each center point
5. The shirt is likely a rectangle, any distortion is likely from wearing it
6. Move shirt to clean edge
7. Pins should be directly on top of clean edge (don’t fold the T-shirt)
	a. Front and back of shirt should be evenly on top of each other
	b. Check that the seams are on top of each other
	c. Make sure the shirt is flat
8. With a pencil, draw the bottom and side of the shirt on the paper. Stop at the bottom of the armhole
9. Draw vertical lines at the tip of armhole, bottom of arm hole and outside points of sleeve
10. Pin armhole bottom
11.  Poke every ½” through center seam
12. Pin through front neckline, through the rib seam
13. At the back neck, start at the vertical line, pine through the center of the back-neck tape
14. Remove pins
15. Lightly sketch and connect dots with a pencil
16. Use triangle or t square to draw 90 angles from the center at the front and back neck curves
17. Check if there is a drop or rise on the lower hem – hem usually comes up for a fitted T
18. Lower lines should start at 90
19. Straighten the shoulder seam with a ruler
20. Top of armhole seam is 90 degrees with top of shoulder
21. Use a French curve to smooth out arm hole seam
22. Side seam is either straight down or curved in from armhole
23. Use French Curve to draw front and back necklines
	- Necklines must meet center at 90 degrees for 1/8”
	- As little of neckline as possible should be flat but must meet at shoulder
24. Use clear plastic ruler and measure the length of the top and bottom necks.
	- Start at 1” on the ruler and hold the ruler vertically
	- Write down the measurements on the inside of the pattern pieces
27. Use the ruler to measure the length if the arm hole
	- Write down the measurement on the inside of the pattern
	- Mark the center of the armhole
	- Double check by measuring from both sides of the armhole
28. Cut out back neck void
29. Label the pattern pieces in pen on the front of the pattern center line down to the right on the grainline
30. Label the back void piece ( Do not lose this piece )

## T-Shirt Sleeve Pattern Drafting

1.     Draw a 90 degrees L that is about 10” x 10”

2.     Put shirt upside down with top fold of sleeve on line. The top of the arm hole should be in the corner

3.     Pin through arm hole seam every ½”

4.     Measure sleeve cap armhole seam with flexible ruler. It should be the same as the torso pattern

5.     Halfway up put a notch on armhole seam

6.     Straighten lower sleeve with ruler

7.     Does not have to be 90 degrees under the arm

8.     Draw grainline perpendicular to the top

9.     Cut out the sleeve

10.  Measure the height of the rib collar

11.  Draw square rectangle double the length of front neck and void piece square off the ends – should be 15-20% smaller than the neck

## Drafting Full Pattern Pieces

1.     Get new piece of Paper

2.     Lay torso piece on paper and trace around

3.     Flip over the center to mirror and trace full pattern

4.     Tur up lines and transfer armhole notches

5.     Center line becomes the grainline

6.     Add seam allowances with your clear ruler

a.     ½” seam allowance is safe, add 5/8” if you want more option to change fit

b.     ¼” seam allowance on neckline

c.     Add ⅞” to ¾” at bottom for hem

7.     Use back void piece to draw back pattern

8.     Draw sleeve pattern, repeating the steps above

# Pants Pattern

## Front Leg Piece

1.     Lay down with front piece flat on top

2.     Poke pin waist band of pants

3.     Poke pins along outside seam

4.     Remove pants

5.     Pencil in lines lightly with pencil

6.     Average middle of pants draw a vertical grain line

7.     Get Hip curve

8.     Draw top of hip

9.     Use long ruler to straighten out the outside led

10.  Crotches start straight at the top and then make a J

11.  For inseam, don’t push out too far

12.  Measure inseam, out seam, waist and write measurements on the inside of the pattern

13.  True the pocket void

14.  Side seam is 90 degrees at pocket

15.  Slash pockets straight line

16.  Label down and to the right

## Back Pants Piece

1.     Lay pants face down

2.     Smooth out – stretch and smooth the crotch to lay flat – working on the side that has the fly may help to make pants lay flat

3.     Poke pin the waist band

4.     If pants have a back yoke, skip it since it needs to be isolated on its own

5.     Poke pin the crotch J

6.     Remove pants and trace pin lines

7.     Rear crotch J can be an s curve

8.     Measure inseam, out seam and waist

9.     Adjust inseam and out seam to match front

10.  Keep J and waist proportions and placements

11.  Need to add yoke height if it is there

12.  Mark dart locations if present

a.     Pin the dartline marking the beginning and the end of the dart

b.     Measure the width of the dart

c.     Add the width of the dart to each side of the pattern piece when truing the pattern

d.     Taper the dart width into the side of the pattern about double the length of the dart

13.  To get the full piece you can measure under the inseam and add to the traced seam or you can put a fold in the pants and a fold in your paper, then you can trace both seams

14.  Mark the pocket locations
