# Additive Processes
Additive processes rely on adding more of the same material to the object until the desired form is achieved. These range from sculpting with clay to [[3D Printing]].

When sculpting with water based clay or oil clay an armature is often used. An armature is a support structure made of metal and / or wood that allows the soft clay to keep its shape while being worked on. Armatures can use low density materials such as paper and foam to quickly bulk up the form of an object or to make a hollow object.
