# Fabrication 
When you fabricate you use methods of attaching different materials together such as screwing, glueing or bolting. [[Welding]] is a special case of fabrication since it usually uses the same material as the pieces being joined together.

Many different materials can be used in fabrication including metal, plastic, wood, soft foams, fabric, clay, carbon fiber and many more.

## Triangles are Strong 
Triangles are strong, L's are lame and squares are okay, and circles are amazing but hard to use

## Metal Fabrication Examples
[[Steel Fence Joints]]

## Wood Fabrication examples
[[Wood fasteners]]
### Fabrication Tools
[[Jigs]]

### Digital Calipers
> "Calipers may read to a resolution of 0.01 mm or 0.0005 in, but accuracy may not be better than about ±0.02 mm or 0.001 in for 150 mm (6 in) calipers, and worse for longer one."
