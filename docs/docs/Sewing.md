# Sewing
Sewing is the process to use thread to mechanically attach to print planer pieces of [[fabric]] together. Generally, the pieces are cut in specific shapes that after so together will create a three-dimensional form. Often these forms are to fit around the shape of the human body or a piece of architecture. 
## Hand Sewing vs Machine Sewing
Hand sewing can be done anywhere and doesn't need electricity. Early sewing machines also did not need electricity but instead used the caloric burn of the operator through a foot pedal to move the needle and make stitches.

The stiches made by hand are different than those made by a lock stich machine. A machine stich will generally be more consistent, faster, and stronger than a hand stich.

Whenever possible a machine should be used to see materials together so time is not wasted with less effective hand stitching. Just about every kind of stich can be made by various sewing machines. A notable exception is a decorative hand stiched bottonhole.
### Types of Hand Stiches
- Blind stitch 
- Blanket stich
- Whip stich
- Buttonhole stich
- Backstich
### Types of Machines
Lock Stich
Overlook Stitch
### Domestic vs Industrial Machines
Domestic or consumer sewing machines are cheap and versitle. Most can to a multitude o stitch types but because they are not single purpose built they tend to do each task worse than a dedicated machine.  For example, on multi-purpose domestic machine may have an edge stitch function to try to capture fraying fabric edges, but it would be no match for even a domestic serger.

All domestics sewing machines can sew in a straight line, but they will be limited in the thickness of fabric that they can sew through, and the number of layers of even thin fabric that they can sew through as well as how thicker thread can't be used. Generally, if one is careful, they can work around these issues. But eventually the strength and specific built purpose of industrial machines is essential to make sewn objects.
## Different Machine Sewn Seams
### Straight
### Flat Felled

Electric sewing machines - after the introduction of the electric sewing machine vs the pedal driven machine it saved -15 calories an hour which added up to -51000 calories a year, enough to run a few marathons.

## Sewing FAQ
1. How can I use thicker thread in the machine?

You need to use a larger needle. We have larger needles and the cabinet. A size 16 or 18 will work. You also need to adjust the bobbin case tension. When adjusting the bobbin case tension the little turn of the screw goes a long way. Maybe eighth to a quarter turn.
