# Welding

Welding is the process of fusing metal together at high temperatures so that individual pieces of metal become a simgle piece of metal. Thermoplastics that can also be fused together with welding processes.

### Types of Welding
### Gas Welding
Oxyacetylene welding uses acetylene gas and oxygen that combine together in a torch to create a very hot and concentrated flame. This flame is hot enough to melt steel and provides some protection from atmospheric impurities. An oxyacetylene torch is also commonly used for [[brazing]] and the cutting of thick pieces of metal.
