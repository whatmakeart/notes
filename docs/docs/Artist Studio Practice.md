# Artist Studio Practice
Artists need a place to make their work. An artist's workspace is called their studio. It is important to have good studio practices,good [[professional practices]], and good [[safety]] practices. 

## Batch process everything 
Make Studio Work Like a One Person Factory. Instead of doing all the steps of a process in order if you need to make 50 of something. And do step one 50 times then step two 50 times then step 3 50 times then step four 50 times. This will be much faster and efficient and will result in higher quality output. Then if you did step one then step two then step three, then step four 50 times in a row.

## Media Compentency vs Literacy
The difference between media competency and media literacy media literacy is just being a consumer of the content media competency is being able to make a podcast or produce something.
