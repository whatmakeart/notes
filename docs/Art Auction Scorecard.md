# Art Auction Scorecard
Before donating your artwork to a benefit auction at a gallery or museum ask yourself these questions about the auction to see if you are being taken advantage of.

1. Is a percentage of sale price given to artist?

2. Does the artist have a chioce to keep that percentage or donate it if they choose?

3. Is the minimum bid the market price for the artist?

4. If there a ticket price for the event, does an artist recieve a ticket? 2? 1? 

5. Does the artist need to forfiet their portion of sale to recieve a ticket?

6. Does the venue tell the artist who purchased their work and provide contact info?

7. Does the venue insure the work?

An artist should always have *the option* of recieving a 50% share of the sale price. An artist should always recieve a free ticket to offset their time and labor of bringing the work to and *possibly* from the space.
