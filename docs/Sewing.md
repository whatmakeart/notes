# Sewing
Sewing is the process to use thread to mechanically attach to print planer pieces of [[fabric]] together. Generally, the pieces are cut in specific shapes that after so together will create a three-dimensional form. Often these forms are to fit around the shape of the human body or a piece of architecture. 
## Hand Sewing vs Machine Sewing
Hand sewing can be done anywhere and doesn't need electricity. Early sewing machines also did not need electricity but instead used the caloric burn of the operator through a foot pedal to move the needle and make stitches.

The stitches made by hand are different than those made by a lock stitch machine. A machine stitch will generally be more consistent, faster, and stronger than a hand stitch.

Whenever possible a machine should be used to see materials together so time is not wasted with less effective hand stitching. Just about every kind of stitch can be made by various sewing machines. A notable exception is a decorative hand stitched buttonhole.
### Types of Hand Stitches
- Blind stitch 
- Blanket stitch
- Whip stich
- Buttonhole stich
- Backstich
### Types of Machines
Lock Stich
Overlook Stitch
### Domestic vs Industrial Machines
Domestic or consumer sewing machines are cheap and versatile. Most can to a multitude o stitch types but because they are not single purpose built they tend to do each task worse than a dedicated machine.  For example, on multi-purpose domestic machine may have an edge stitch function to try to capture fraying fabric edges, but it would be no match for even a domestic serger.

All domestics sewing machines can sew in a straight line, but they will be limited in the thickness of fabric that they can sew through, and the number of layers of even thin fabric that they can sew through as well as how thicker thread can't be used. Generally, if one is careful, they can work around these issues. But eventually the strength and specific built purpose of industrial machines is essential to make sewn objects.
## Different Machine Sewn Seams
### Straight
A straight seam is made by placing the 'right' sides of the fabric together lining up the edges. Then the fabric is fed through the sewing machine under the presser foot with the desired seam allowance, which is how much space is left between the stitching and the cut edge.

### True Flat Felled
A true flat-filled seem has interlocking edges of fabric and two sets of stitching going through four layers of the fabric. This is done with specialty equipment and machines that feed the fabric into the presser foot and make the fold.

With a bit of practice and some ingenuity, this can also be made on a straight stitch machine or a domestic home sewing machine. It is not as fast but it is just as strong. Flat-filled seams are often used on the inside inseam of pants so they do not split since they go through four layers of fabric.
### Faux Flat Felled
A Faux Flat Felled seam is made starting with the wrong sides of the fabric together lining up the edges. Then press the seam to one side. Trim the lower seam allowance in half. Fold the top seam allowance around the bottom seam allowance enclosing it. Use an iron to press the seam allowance flat and around the bottom allowance. Make sure the width is even. Stitch a second set of stitches along this folded edge. This seam is not as strong as a true flat-felled seam that goes through four layers of fabric twice.
### French Seam
A french seam is made by placing the wrong sides of the fabric together lining up the edges.
### Busted Seam
This seam is often seen on the outside of jeans. Sometimes it uses the selvage edge of the fabric. The selvage edge of the fabric is the factory edge that does not unravel. Other times it uses surged edges of fabric. It is a basic straight seam that then is pressed flat and open, or "busted" open.

## Sewing FAQ
1. How can I use thicker thread in the machine?

You need to use a larger needle. We have larger needles and the cabinet. A size 16 or 18 will work. You also need to adjust the bobbin case tension. When adjusting the bobbin case tension the little turn of the screw goes a long way. Maybe eighth to a quarter turn.
