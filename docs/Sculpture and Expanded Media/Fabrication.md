# Fabrication 
Fabrication uses methods of attaching different materials together such as screwing, glueing or bolting. 

Many different materials can be used in fabrication including metal, plastic, wood, soft foams, fabric, clay, carbon fiber and many more.

## Fabrication Design Principles
### Triangles are Strong 
Triangles are strong, L's are lame and squares are okay, and circles are amazing but hard to use

## Metal Fabrication
[[Welding]] is a special case of fabrication since it usually uses the same material as the pieces being joined together.

[[Steel Fence Joints]]

## Wood Fabrication
[[Wood Fasteners]]

## Digital Fabrication
Digital fabrication uses [[3D Modeling]] to create digital designs and then outputs the digital model to a physical form. Digital fabrication machines use gcode to translate the shape and size of the 3D model into a specific set of instructions or operations for the machine to execute. Stepper motors, linear rails, proximity sensors, computer vision and other industrial controls keep track of the precise location on the machine and material being fabricated.
### Types of Digital Fabrication
[[Laser Cutting]] uses a high powered laser to cut through wood, metal and plastic. A laser cutter can also etch designs and images.
[[CNC]] Machining uses spinning cutters that move along a precise coordinate system.  
[[3D Printing]] builds up an object layer by layer.
[[Vinylc Cutting]] cuts rolls of vinyl based on vector graphic input.
[[Water Jet Cutting]] uses high powered streams of water carrying abrasive particles to cut through a wide variety of materials.

### Fabrication Tools
[[Jigs]]

### Digital Calipers
> "Calipers may read to a resolution of 0.01 mm or 0.0005 in, but accuracy may not be better than about Â±0.02 mm or 0.001 in for 150 mm (6 in) calipers, and worse for longer one."
