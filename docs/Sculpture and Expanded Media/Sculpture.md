# Sculpture 
In the past sculpture was limited to using a few materials such as stone, clay, metal and focused on representational depiction. Now sculpture has expanded to encompass all forms of making ranging from previously used stone and clay to electronics, welding, organic foods, fur, glass, performance, [[video]], computers, and Virtual Reality. Other than focusing on 3D dimensional space versus the 2D concerns of drawing, painting, and [[photography]] there are no real limits or boundaries for sculpture. This was famously described by Rosalind Krauss in the 1979 _October_ article "Sculpture in the Expanded Field". ^[Krauss, Rosalind. “Sculpture in the Expanded Field.” _October_ 8 (1979): 31–44. https://doi.org/10.2307/778224.]

The wide array of materials and processes available to a sculptor is great because it allows any concept and idea to be realized. This wide field of possibilities is also a burden because so many techniques and ways of making must be learned in order to successfully realize different ideas.

## What is a Sculpture?
The form of the question already limits the answer. By asking what a sculpture is. We are already assuming it is the discreet object. Is that always the case?

"What is the practice of sculpture?" may be a better question. Or at least asking what is the purpose of the action? Does the action result in a physical change in the universe? Does it affect people who would see or feel or touch or smell or taste the results of a proposed action?

What if the action never happens and it is just a concept?

## Types of Sculpture 
There are many types of sculpture but the unifying attribute of all of them as that they exist in 3D space. Even 100% conceptual sculptures exist in the 3D space occupying the synapses of the brain.

### Low Relief Sculpture vs Freestanding Sculpture
[[Low Relief Sculpture]] resembles two dimensional art more than three dimensional free standing sculpture. Low Relief Sculpture extends out from a flat or planer surface. Parts of it can be fully 3D but will resemble "peninsulas of sculpture" that protrude out from a plane. The plane can be flat, geometric, round, organic or undulating but will defer be planar in nature and have a "back".
### Installation 
Sculptural [[art installation|art installations]] can be site-specific or non site-specific.

### Interactive Sculpture 
Some sculptures or art installations become more alive or complete once an audience engages withe the art.  This audience interaction can be as simple as being in the same spaces, the artwork can be as complex as a computer vision driven people tracking device using [[Physical Computing]]. 

### Representational Sculpture 
For much of history most scultpture was representational, meaning that it attempted to visually depiect physical forms visible in the world.
### Non-Representational Sculpture 

### Site Specific Sculpture 
[[Site Specific]] artwork and sculpture is made for a specific location or locations. It meaning, intent and reception will change if displayed in another location or context. Some site specific sculpture that relies on the architecture of a particular place for physical support may not even be able to be displayed anywhere else without heavy modifications.

### Earthworks
Earthworks are a special type of site specific sculpture that use the landscape as site. Earthworks are usually large in scale and alter the surrounding area and earth into the form of the sculpture. The sculpture and the site become one.

### Public Art
Public art is generally made on a commission basis. Artists or artworks are selected by public agencies through an open competitive process. Public art is made of durable materials designed to last a long time exposed to environmental elements.

### Kinetic Sculpture 
[[Kinetic Sculpture]] is not static but moves in space. The source of the movement could be a motor, or a natural cause such as flowing water, or the wind. 

## How to make a Sculpture?
What is your idea? What do you want to communicate? Are you making a unique object or a series. Setting up an [[Artist Studio]] will give you a place to make sculpture.

Generally it is a good idea to start with [[sketching]] out different ideas and variations of those ideas.

#### Ways of Making Objects 
There are only five main ways  to make any physical object. The ways of making any three-dimensional object are [[additive]], [[Subtractive Processes]], [[Fabrication]], [[deformation]] and [[Casting]]. These ways of making do not exisit in isolation and often will be combined to make a final sculptural object or installation.

##### Sewing
[[Sewing]] is a [[Fabrication]] process using fabric and thread. The types of fabric and thread vary widely depending on the desired outcome. Sewing relies on assembling flat planar pieces of fabric in ways that make a three-dimensional form.

##### Welding 
[[Welding]] joins different pieces of metal together to make a new piece of metal that is actually a single piece. The metal is melted and fused together usually using a filler rod of metal. Common types of welding can be include oxyacetylene welding, TIG welding, MIG welding, and stick Arc Welding.

[[Brazing]] is a sculptural process related to welding since it joins multiple pieces of metal together but instead of melting the joined pieces, brazing merely heats them to a red hot temperature. This expands the grain structure of the metals so there is physical space between the grain structure. A filler metal that melts at a cooler temperature that the metals being joined is used to mechanically attach the metals. The melted joining metal flows into the gaps of the red hot expanded metal pieces. Flux is used to promote the capillary flow of the filler metal into these spaces. After everything cools the pieces are now mechanically joined.

##### Clay Sculpting 
[[Clay sculpture]] is an [[additive]] and [[Subtractive Processes]], sculpture process. Pieces of clay are joined together or cut away to make the desired form. Clay is malleable and can be easily deformed to achieve a desired shape. Two common types of clay used in sculpture are water based ceramic clay and oil based [[oil clay]].
